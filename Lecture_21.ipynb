    "\n",
    "uvicorn app:app --reload\n",
    "\n",
    "The --reload option ensures that the server automatically restarts whenever you make changes to the code.\n",

    "### Creating Custom API Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI allows you to create custom API endpoints easily. Here's an example of creating a custom endpoint where the user can input their name, and the API will return a greeting message.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/hello/{name}\"): This defines the GET endpoint /hello/{name}.\n",
    "The name parameter is passed as part of the URL, and the function returns a greeting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this endpoint, run the server and visit the URL in the browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/YourName.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FastAPI Documentation (Swagger)\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI automatically generates documentation for your API. This documentation is known as Swagger and provides a user-friendly interface to interact with your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the documentation, simply add /docs to your FastAPI app's URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.\n",
    "FastAPI also provides an alternative interactive documentation at /redoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc.\n",
    "In the documentation, you'll find:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The API's title, description, and version.\n",
    "2. A list of available endpoints.\n",
    "3. Options to test the endpoints interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running and Stopping FastAPI Applications\n",
    "Running the FastAPI Application\n",
    "To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "uvicorn app:app --reload\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stopping the FastAPI Application\n",
    "To stop the FastAPI server, press CTRL + C in the terminal where the server is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this guide, we covered the basics of FastAPI, including setting up the environment, creating custom API endpoints, and using FastAPI's automatic documentation. We also explored how to run and stop FastAPI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is a powerful tool for building APIs and offers several advantages, such as ease of use, high performance, and automatic API documentation. As you become more familiar with FastAPI, you'll be able to create more complex endpoints and even develop applications for AI and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future lectures, we will explore more advanced FastAPI topics and develop projects to apply everything we've learned.\n",
